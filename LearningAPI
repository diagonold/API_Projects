Learning how to use/creat APIs

what is an API in simple terms?
think of this scenario, you are in a restaurant 
you want created your own order and gave the RECIPE to the WAITER
the WAITER then goes to the KITCHEN to cook your food
the WAITER comes back with your ORDER

this analogy describes an API very well
the python script you wrote is person ordering
the RECIPE is the request you made
the WAITER is the API that helps communicate your order to the kitchen


REST in a nutshell

what does REST API mean?
	REST is basically a set of useful conventions for structurring a web API
	
what is a web API?
	it just means you interact with an HTTP, making request to specific URLs and getting 
	relevant data in return. 

GET and POST
	GET is generally used to get information about some record that already exist
	often we will see this data in forms of 'JSON objects' which are very similar
	to dictionary in python
	sudo syntax: HTTP GET to the URL /tasks/
	
	POST is typically used when you want to create something.
	sudo syntax: HTTP POST to URL /tasks/

	as you can see we get and post to the same URL

other methods like 
PUT		modify an existing resource
DELETE	delete data 


Talking in REST
	 in many web services, we create RESTful API as this is a good format for passing
	and receiving data back.
	take note that JSON format is popular in API

	in order to do this in python, we need an excellent HTTP library called requests


what is a JSON data format?


Constructing an API library
	we need to make an API library if we will be using that service a lot
	the structure of the library depends on how API authenticates
	let us get to the basic structure first and worry about the authentication layer later

	To form on the  basic structure
	decide on the services it provides
	1. get a summary list of task that need be done with the API
	2. get more detailed information on a specifc task
	3. add mew task to our lists
	4. can mark task as done
	5. modify an existing tasks

	with this framework we can create our own internal API
